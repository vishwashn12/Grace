# ── LLM classifier ─────────────────────────────────────────────
_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """\
You are a customer support intent classifier for an e-commerce platform.
Classify the customer message into exactly ONE of these categories:

order_status    - Asking about a SPECIFIC order: its status, delivery date, payment type, payment value,
                  category, tracking, or any order-level detail. The customer expects data from their order record.
                  Examples: "Where is my order?", "What is the payment type for my order?",
                  "Give me the payment value", "Show me my order details", "Has my order shipped?"

delivery_issue  - The order is CONFIRMED LATE, significantly overdue, never arrived, or lost.
                  Examples: "My package never came", "It's been 3 weeks and nothing", "My order is late"

refund_request  - Wants money back, to cancel an order, or initiate a return for a refund.
                  Examples: "I want a refund", "Can I cancel and get my money back?", "How do I return this?"

product_issue   - The received item is broken, defective, wrong, damaged, counterfeit, or missing parts.
                  Examples: "The product is broken", "I got the wrong item", "It's not working at all"

policy_query    - Asking about platform RULES or POLICIES in general — NOT about a specific order.
                  Examples: "What is your return policy?", "How long does a refund take in general?",
                  "What payment methods do you accept?", "Am I eligible for a return?"
                  KEY: if the customer is asking for data FROM their specific order (payment, dates, status),
                  that is order_status — NOT policy_query.

seller_issue    - Complaint specifically about a SELLER/VENDOR behaviour.
                  Examples: "The seller is not responding", "The vendor sent a fake product"

general         - Greetings, thank-yous, vague questions, or anything that doesn't fit the above.
                  Examples: "Hello", "Thank you", "Can you help me?"

CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:
- "What is the payment type for my order?" = order_status (asking for order DATA, not policy)
- "Give me the payment value for order XYZ" = order_status
- "What payment methods does Olist accept?" = policy_query (general platform rule)
- "My order is late" = delivery_issue (NOT seller_issue)
- "How long does a refund take?" = policy_query (NOT refund_request — asking about policy)
- "I want a refund" = refund_request

Customer message: "{query}"
